During my last semester of college, my brother approached me with the oppurtunity to create two commerce websites using Shopify for friends of his. One was for a Vape Store (Hyperlink me) and the other a Aquatics Supply Store (Hyperlink me). I was very lucky to have the oppurtunity to help bring these two store owners online shops to life and feel like I learned a lot in terms of web design and the coding behind it.

For the first site, Treasure Vape, the owner asked me to help create an online website using Shopify with a security window pop up to confirm the users age when entering the site. The security window being main reason why they came to me for help, as they did not want to use an app for it. Over all this included tasks such as managing inventory, and using programming knowledge with HTML, CSS, LIQUID, and JS to help create what the owner was asking. For the most part it was simple, but a good oppurunity to learn and re-learn some of the foundations of a website, even if not built from the ground up. One of the things I learned was Liquid, Shopify's choice of templating language. It is a fairly simple language and it's convience was very nice. The flexibility it allowed straight into HTML pages helped short cut a lot of things.
The hardest challenge I found with this site was honestly just trying to make things look good while keeping the owner happy.

As for the second store, Nature Inspiration Aquarium, the owner asked for a similar service but at a much larger scale and much more complicated needs. They wanted to create a more fanciful website that supported sale for both wholesale and regular shoppers. This included having an account service that differentiated wholesale users and regular ones, having different prices for the same items for both as well as hiding the wholesale prices from regular users. This endeavour taught me a lesson that where Shopify simplifies certain processess, it also complicates others. With Shopify, without making an app all in it's self I could not find an easy way to get back end information for products. My solution to this issue was to create dupplicate products of every item they wanted to show one for wholesale and one for regular users than restrict regular users from viewing the wholesale products. That part in itself was not to much of an issue, but the real issue that came up was with search engines. I never dealt with SEO settings as much as then.

Overall though I felt I learned a lot creating these websites, especially how much thought and planning needs to be put into making them even if using a service like Shopify.
