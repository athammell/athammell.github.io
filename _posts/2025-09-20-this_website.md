Throughout my life scouring the web I've come accross many ways people can represent themselves over the internet. One that stood out to me the most was the web hosting service Neocities.

The creativeness of websites being made by people of different skill levels was inspiring! From fanpages to resumes, personal blogs to full on adventure game style args, it was so cool to see what people made.

As for what I've gained from this little project was mostly learning about how to stylize a website to be friendly, a reminder of how to use CSS, HTML, and JS properly.

So for now I'm leaving pictures this website in it's current state of writing this for future reference to see how it evolves!
